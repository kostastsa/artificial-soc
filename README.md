# artificial-soc
A python implementation of the artificial society game "SugarScape" introduced in the classic book "Growing Artificial Societies" by J.Epstein and R.Axtell.

The SugarScape is a rectangular grid populated by simple agents which posess attributes such as position, vision and sugar. The agents move around on the grid trying to collect sugar. 

This simple model introduces the concept of an agent based model, i.e. a way of simulating agents in order to understand how population-level variables are determined by individual-level behaviours.
